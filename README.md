# DiscordActivityFetcher
## Things you'll need
* A registered Discord bot
* A Discord server just for you and your bot

You need to fill the details in the code (serverID, userID, botToken). You can get the server ID and user ID by entering developer mode on your Discord client and right clicking on each one and selecting 'copy ID'.

Also specify a file for the JSON, for example '/srv/http/discord.json' if you want it to be exposed to Apache directly.

To see a live example visit [my webpage](https://jeffser.github.io), if I have any current activities you'll be able to see them in the mainpage.
